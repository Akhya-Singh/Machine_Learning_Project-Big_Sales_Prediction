# Big Sales Prediction Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file `Akhya_Big_Sales_Prediction.ipynb` that demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting sales of various items in a retail store. The model is built using the Random Forest Regression algorithm and the dataset is obtained from the YBI Foundation.

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting big sales. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze historical sales data and make accurate predictions for future sales. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the goal is to provide insights into sales trends and patterns, enabling businesses to optimize their strategies and maximize revenue.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model that can accurately predict big sales based on historical data. By accurately forecasting sales, businesses can make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. Ultimately, the aim is to enhance profitability and competitiveness in the market.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the sales data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploring of the data to gain insights into sales trends, patterns, and correlations.
- Model Selection: Evaluating and selecting of appropriate machine learning algorithms based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the 'Big Sales Data' dataset, which can be found at the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/main/Big%20Sales%20Data.csv

The dataset contains information about various items sold in retail stores, including item weight, item fat content, item visibility, item type, item MRP (Maximum Retail Price), outlet identifier, outlet establishment year, outlet size, outlet location type, and outlet type.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Akhya_Big_Sales_Prediction.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook follows a structured approach to building and evaluating the machine learning model:

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Import the dataset
3. Perform data exploration and preprocessing
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Standardize numerical features
4. Define the target variable (y) and features (X)
5. Split the data into training and testing sets
6. Train the Random Forest Regression model
7. Make predictions on the test set
8. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score
9. Visualize the actual vs. predicted sales values
